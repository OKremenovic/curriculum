# Codaxy Curriculum

## What is this?

This repository contains Codaxy's own technology curriculum with some helpful learning resources. It is conceived as Codaxy developer's go-to reference that helps all teams and team members to:

- have an overview on what tech Codaxy covers and to what extent
- have a clear understanding of what they should be familiar with (in minimum) and easily communicate requirements to new team members
- stay in sync with other teams/members regarding coding practices, styles, methodologies used
- easily find relevant answers to FAQs and common dilemmas
- review and brush up their skills in their own and foreign areas
- make it easier to direct their research path

## What this is not?

This is in no way a complete list of things a developer should know about, especially in their own field(s) of expertise.

## Categorization

Curriculum is divided into major tracks (JavaScript, SASS, CxJS, etc.). There are some topics ("must-knows") in each track that ideally everyone should be familiar with, regardless of their own field. The rest is for developers of a particular profile.

Topics, or topic groups may be labeled so they can be easily referenced in internal workshops when it makes sense (e.g. *Our next .NET workshop will cover things from **NET-API**, **NET-API-02**, **NET-ERR** and **NET-LOG***), in order to identify intended workshop audience at a glance.

In addition, each group has a label that describes who should be familiar with it:

* **A** - must-know
* **B** - curious about the field
* **C** - junior level
* **D** - medior level
* **E** - senior level
* **F** - lead/research 

Two-letter combinations are possible. For example, **CD** denotes "some topics in this list may be too advanced for fresh juniors, but they should become familiar with them as soon as possible".

## Contribution

The idea is a pilot, and any suggestions to improve the structure are welcome.

Ideally, every important topic (a heading, or a bullet list item) should be a link to the article or some other resource that is most relevant to the topic in question. If there is no link:

- wording should be clear enough so you can easily Google the terms, or find them in a reference book and
- the topic is such that ideally zero style/best practice/convention discrepancies can be introduced by consulting different sources

Since there will usually be more than one link for each topic and some links cover more than one topic, the rest of them can be listed in **Useful links** section within a topic group.

In general, any style/best practice/convention dilemmas should be dealt with explicitly:

- by adding links to existing documents that follow our standard as close as possible (and saying explicitly that "This is the same style/convention/pattern/... that we use")
- by introducing additional documents that will be committed directly into this repository and linked from the curriculum (e.g. **Codaxy SASS conventions**)
